Activity# 5 : Volunteers meet for year 2023-24
Date : December 9th 2023
As part of regular initiatives, we all volunteers meet and discuss the set of events to serve society for the upcoming year. All the food was self sponsored and this is how we maintain the dignity of our NGO. We all met, had fruitful discussions and jot down the events to perform for the year.
