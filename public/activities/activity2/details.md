Activity# 2 : Sponsorship of education for under-privileged kids for 2024 academic year 

Date : July 23rd 2024 

As one of the main vision of Rupee For Humanity, we sponsored education for under-privileged kids in and around Bengaluru. As part of transparency, all transactions are performed through cheque and it is written directly to school but not to any parent. This is how we support literacy in all possible ways. Overall 4 kids were sponsored on this day who are daily wage laborers and not able to afford education for the kids. RFH performed background check of these kids and went ahead for admission process.
