Activity# 3 : Re-cycling of old footwear to support greener environment 

Date : June 5th 2024 

Rupee For Humanity always wants to work for greener environment and one of the ways is to re-cycle the waste which gets burnt in environment which results in pollution and damaging ozone layer. As part of this idea, we collected around 300 footwears in and around Bengaluru and tied with up “Greensole foundation” which refurbishes the footwear and donates them to needy. This overall process was very tiresome, but the achievement was satisfying. We received appreciation from “Greensole foundation” for this initiate.
